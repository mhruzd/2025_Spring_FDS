## **Objective**  
Demonstrate your understanding of data visualization principles by creating an informative and well-annotated plot using `ggplot` in R. You will present your plot in a recorded video and engage with your peers by providing constructive feedback on their visualizations.  

## **Instructions**  

### **1. Find a Dataset**  
Choose one of the following:  
- A dataset provided in class.  
- A dataset from your own research or work experience.  
- A publicly available dataset from a credible source (Kaggle, government databases, academic repositories).  

### **2. Create an R Markdown Report (50 points)**  
- Use `ggplot2` to create **at least one** well-designed and well-annotated plot (or multiple plots) that meaningfully describe your dataset.  

- Apply best practices in data visualization, such as:  
  - Choosing an appropriate plot type for your data.  
  - Using clear labels, titles, and legends.  
  - Selecting effective color schemes.  
  - Showing the data in a way that avoids misleading interpretations.  
  - Encoding three or more variables when possible.

- Provide a short written explanation of your plot, addressing:  
  - What the plot shows and why it’s appropriate for your data.  
  - Which visualization principles were applied.  
  - Any design choices made to improve readability or clarity.  

- Include your **fully reproducible code** in an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file.  

### **3. Video Presentation (50 points)**  
- Record a **3-5-minute video** explaining your visualization.  
- Your video should include:  
  - A brief introduction to your dataset.  
  - A walkthrough of your plot(s), describing the insights they reveal.  
  - An overview of the code used to generate the plot.  
  - A discussion of the **data visualization principles applied** in your work.  
- Post your video in the Chat section on Canvas no later than **11:59 PM on Sunday, 2/23**.  

### **4. Peer Review (50 points)**  
- Watch **at least five** of your classmates’ videos.  
- Provide **thoughtful and constructive comments** on each, focusing on:  
  - Strengths of their plot design and presentation.  
  - Suggestions for improvement (if applicable).  
- Document your comments in your `.Rmd` file (include the names of the videos you reviewed).  
- Submit the updated `.Rmd` file with your own plot code/comments and your peer review comments on Canvas no later than **11:59 PM on Wednesday, 2/26**.  

## **Grading Breakdown**  

| **Category**                 | **Points** |  
|------------------------------|------------|  
| Well-designed ggplot with clear annotations and applied principles | 50 |  
| Video presentation with clear explanation and visualization discussion | 50 |  
| Peer review with meaningful feedback on five classmates' videos | 50 |  
| **Total** | **150** |  

## **Additional Notes**  
- Ensure your plots and video are accessible and understandable to someone unfamiliar with your dataset.  
- Be concise but thorough in your explanations.  
- Use proper formatting and grammar in your `.Rmd` file and comments.  
- Engage respectfully and constructively in your peer reviews.

*Happy plotting!*
